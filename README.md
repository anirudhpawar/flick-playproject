# flick-playproject
As a beginner, this project I have used HTML(50%), CSS(55%), JAVASCRIPT(5%). About project: It Is a movie &amp; trailer streaming website. There are a lot of people who lose the privilege of entertainment because of its cost. People today have to pay to get relaxed. There are many websites available that allow its users to view movies and their trailers but there is a handful of websites that allow us to watch its content free of cost and without interruption that is without advertisements. So to overcome this problem we plan to introduce this website where everyone can get entertained free of cost and without interruption. So this websites allow everyone to come and enjoy and get their mind relieved. " This website how different from other websites is it has a great interface, where you can feel premium cinematic looks by just seeing the website and the quality of the videos are 1080p to 4K ".
